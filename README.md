# Cat-Tinder-App

![Cat Tinder Cats view](http://webdesignbypm.com/images/catTinderWeb.jpg)

Combine front (React) and back (Rails) end together for the first time.

View a list of all cats with their name, age and 'enjoys'.  Also view a form to add a new cat.  Icebox items include deleting cats, styling cards (adding images, justifying, padding, etc), adding a Favorite/Liked view/page, adding in a home page, and more fun cat features.

Day 1:
Build out React view; use React Bootstrap, choose a theme.  Set up Routes/Switches.

Day 2:
Build out Rails and Active Record.  Seed the database.
--ran into mega issues in Cloud9, had to clone down to local machine and lost a couple hours between troubleshooting that and prepping code to actually function on local maching (yarn instead of npm, ruby version manager to tie needed Gems to the version of Ruby we needed.

Day 3:
When new cat is created, redirect to the all-cat listing to show it's been added to the database.  Met the stretch goal of also Deleting a cat on click; icebox items still include adding mini profile to click into for each cat.
